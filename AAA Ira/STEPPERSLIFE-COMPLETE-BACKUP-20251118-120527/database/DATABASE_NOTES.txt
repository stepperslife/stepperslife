STEPPERSLIFE DATABASE NOTES
===========================

Current .env configuration points to:
- Host: localhost
- Port: 5437
- Database: stepperslife
- User: stepperslife

NOTE: Port 5437 is actually signprintingusa-postgres container.
No dedicated stepperslife PostgreSQL container was found running.

The database may:
1. Not be set up yet (new project)
2. Have incorrect .env configuration
3. Use a different database setup

For restoration:
- Create a new PostgreSQL container for stepperslife
- Update the .env with correct credentials
- Run Prisma migrations: npx prisma migrate deploy

Prisma schema is included in code/prisma/schema.prisma
