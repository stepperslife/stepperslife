STEPPERSLIFE MINIO/UPLOADS NOTES
================================

Current .env configuration:
- MINIO_ENDPOINT=localhost
- MINIO_PORT=9001
- MINIO_BUCKET=stepperslife-uploads

NOTE: No dedicated stepperslife MinIO container was found running.
The port 9001 is a console port for other MinIO instances.

For restoration:
- Create a new MinIO container for stepperslife
- Use ports like 9009 (API) and 9109 (console)
- Update the .env with correct credentials
- Create the 'stepperslife-uploads' bucket
